    "PyCity Schools Analysis:\n",
    "  \n",
    "Analysis of our high-level snapshot of the schools show that students not only pass, but also score higher in reading classes when compared to math classes. Additionally, the percentage of students that pass both math and reading is noticeably lower than students who pass at least one of the subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more in-depth analysis of the highest and lowest performing schools, which is sorted in reference to the their overall passing rate, reveal a discernable pattern. The top 5 highest performing schools are all charter schools with a relatively low number of students, with four out of five enrolling less than 2000. Conversely, the five lowest performing schools are all district schools that have anywhere from 2917 to 4761 students enrolled. It is apparent that the charter school's methods, which operate independently from the state's school system, in addition to its smaller class sizes set up its students for the highest probability of success. Meanwhile, students in district schools with large class sizes seem to suffer the most. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, for every school in the district, we compared the average math and reading scores of the students from 9th grade to 12th grade. The grade that the students are in have an almost negligible impact on their average scores for either subject, with most variations coming in at or below one percent. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we calculated how much each school spends on each student by dividing that schoolâ€™s budget with its total student population. Shockingly, the schools that spent the most on each student had the worst metrics across the board. Average scores, passing percentages for each subject, and especially overall passing percentages of the students were significantly worse than schools who spent the least amount of money per student. The main outlier in this data is Thomas High School, which spends some of the most money, yet still has stellar student results. This can be explained by the fact that Thomas High School is a charter school with a relatively low student population, reaffirming our theory that this combination is the recipe for student success. Clearly, these schools with large student bodies and even larger budgets are not effectively using their funds to create a thriving environment for their students.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A deeper analysis into school sizes and types seems to reaffirm our previous theories. Schools with a small to medium student body (<1000-2000 total students) show signs of success in relation to average scores and the percentage of students who not only pass one subject but pass both. Meanwhile, students in schools with large student bodies (2000-5000 total students) suffer immensely, with their overall pass rate for both subjects and their pass rate for math being 58% and 70% respectively. Students in general seem to have better scores and higher chance of passing reading classes rather than math classes, but these areas are also somewhat lacking in these schools. Finally, charter schools boast significantly higher metrics when compared to district schools, especially their math and overall pass rates.\n"
