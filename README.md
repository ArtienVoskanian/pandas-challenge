This challenge involved analyzing key data from two csv files. After merging the files into one coherent data frame, our analysis could begin. The data revolved around the schools in a certain district and the overall performance of the students at these schools. First, a very broad analysis was done, calculating the total students, budget, average math/reading scores, pass rates for each subject, and overall pass rate for both subjects for all the schools in this district.

Next a more detailed analysis was done for each specific school, revealing much more pertinent and enlightening information on each schoolâ€™s performance. Finding the schools with the highest overall student success as well as the schools with the lowest overall performance revealed several interesting patterns that would later be further substantiated. In short, charter schools with low student populations had the best student success.

Analysis of the students in each of the four grades that were available in this data set (9th to 12th grade) was also done in this project. It revealed no statistically significant findings. Student averages in the 9th grade were heavily mirrored in each of the other grades, regardless of subject matter, school type, budget, and various other factors. 

Finally, the scores of students were grouped in relation to school spending, then school size, and finally school type. The data reaffirms our previous theories that students charter schools with smaller class sizes perform the best, while students in large district schools with big budgets end up suffering the most.
